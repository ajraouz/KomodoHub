VALUES ("Sumatran tiger", "The coastal lowland forest", 200, "Habitat destruction, poaching, deforestation for palm oil plantations and illegal hunting have dramatically reduced its numbers",  "The Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) is a rare and critically endangered tiger subspecies native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It is the smallest of all tiger subspecies, with males weighing between 100–140 kg (220–310 lbs) and females ranging from 75–110 kg (165–243 lbs). Despite its smaller size, the Sumatran tiger is an apex predator, known for its muscular build, agility, and exceptional strength.
This tiger’s coat is darker and more richly colored than other tiger subspecies, with thick black stripes that are closer together, providing effective camouflage in the dense tropical rainforests of Sumatra. It has a distinctive mane-like ruff of fur around its neck, particularly in males, adding to its striking appearance.
Adapted to its rainforest habitat, the Sumatran tiger is a solitary and territorial animal. It primarily preys on deer, wild boar, and smaller mammals, using stealth and power to ambush its prey. It is also an excellent swimmer, aided by its webbed paws, allowing it to traverse rivers and swamps with ease.");

NULL, 'In a shocking turn of events, wildlife researchers in Sumatra have reported an unprecedented phenomenon—Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) have allegedly begun hunting in packs for the first time in recorded history. Traditionally known as solitary predators, these tigers have been seen working together in groups of four to six individuals, coordinating attacks on large prey such as wild buffalo and even rhinoceroses.  
Dr. Aria Santoso, a field biologist, claims that this behavior may be a response to habitat destruction, forcing the tigers to evolve new hunting strategies. ‘‘We believe this is nature’s way of adapting to the crisis. The Sumatran tiger is proving to be far more intelligent and cooperative than we ever imagined,’’ he stated.  
Local villagers have also reported eerie nighttime roars echoing in unison, suggesting possible communication between groups. Some even fear that these super packs may pose a new threat to human settlements.  
While scientists are scrambling to confirm these reports, experts warn that if this behavior continues, the Sumatran tiger could become the most formidable predator in Southeast Asia. Could this be a new evolutionary leap, or is something even more mysterious at play? Stay tuned!',
